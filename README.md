# Employee Stat Generator

 
  
## Description
My motivation for this project was to create an easy way to insert your employee's information onto an organized webpage. This generator would make it simpler for other's to easily input info. I learned a lot about inquirer, connecting javascript to html, and working with Jest. I did not complete this project on time, but I did learn so much that I will keep coming back to this project to get it finished.
